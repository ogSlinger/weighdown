- Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
  - The assignment provided was a choice between three applications to develop for the course. The one I chose to develop was the weight tracking application. The assignment given was as follows.
  - > This application will be used to track the daily weight of the user. This application must include the following features:
>A database with at least three tables: one to store the daily weight, one to store user logins and passwords, and one to store the goal weight 
>Note that goal weight will be constant but setting a one-time weight that is stored in a database will be the simplest way for you to accomplish this task.
>A screen for logging into the app
>Note that the screen for logging into the app should also be used to create a login if the user has never logged in before.
>A screen with a grid that displays all the daily weights and the days they were entered
>A mechanism by which the user can add a daily weight
>A mechanism by which the user can add a goal weight
>A mechanism by which the application will notify the user when they reach their goal weight
- What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

- How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?

- How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?

- Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

- In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
